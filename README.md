# OWW

One With Web is a React app created to practice, test, and demonstrate some amazing possibilities for client websites.

## OWW ~= WOW!

The general layout, and design features of this website are not meant to be consistent across all domains of the site, but varied. Each page demonstrates a totally unique design modality.

Over time, while I learn new Frontend tricks, the site will be updated with the most amazing creations I can come up with.

### Design Packages Implemented So Far:

-   React Bootstrap w/ Bootswatch

### Incoming Ideas:

-   GSAP (Horizontal panel-scroll page, other scrolltrigger animations)
-   Entire Homepage is just 100mvh, all elements operate on scrolltrigger
-   Parralax effects w/ react-spring: https://www.react-spring.dev/
